LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). 
It helps developers connect LLMs with external data and build context-aware applications easily.
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. 
It combines a retriever model with a generator model (LLM) to give accurate and context-based answers.
LLM means Large Language Model like GPT, LLaMA, etc.
